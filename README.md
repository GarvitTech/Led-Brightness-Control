# Led-Brightness-Control
🤖✨ This project uses Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Arduino to control an LED using hand gestures. 🖐️ The distance between fingers is detected using AI and sent to Arduino via Serial Communication to adjust LED brightness in real time. ⚡ A cool mix of computer vision and electronics!
